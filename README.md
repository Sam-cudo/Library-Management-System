# Library-Management-System
A college project developed with asp.net WebForms and bootstrap. It is fully functioning, responsive and dynamic with integration of MySQL server.

## Aim of the Project
The goal of this project is to develop a full-fledged web application to fully automate the manual library system that is now in place, making the entire process of borrowing and returning books, preserving book records, managing library members, etc. more effective and convenient.

## Objectives of the Project
●	To aid the staff in reducing the time spent on each of their work areas.
●	To improve the usability and accessibility of the library's resources.
●	To improve the security and integrity of the library’s data records.
●	To reduce the operational cost of the library.

## Description of the Project
The library management system is a digital E-library system that allows a user to have easy access to the books and resources of the library. And helps the librarian and management maintain a smooth flow of materials in the library. Which includes those books that are in circulation, on the shelves, or borrowed. It can track books that should’ve been returned on certain dates. 
A librarian can add or modify any data about the books and their availability. He/she can also see the list of members in the library and the books they've issued.
Users can use it to register themselves in the library to get the membership and log in to check the books they've issued or returned. The search feature ensures smooth access to find desired books.
The admin or librarian can utilize the automatic 'defaulter list' feature to deactivate the defaulters' accounts or to cancel their membership from the library.
Overall, the library management system is beneficial to both the library management and the users. This fully digital and partly automatic library management system is a better alternative to the most chaotic manual library management systems.

## Future Scope
The library can be entirely digitalized in the future along with the addition of numerous new features and amenities in the application. 

For instance, if a person needs to issue a book, he can submit an issue request through this application. An issue token will be generated and reflected on the librarian's account. Once the librarian approves that token, the student will receive a unique receipt and be able to pick up the book from the library whenever it is convenient for him. 

Email integration is another feature that can be introduced. It can be used to improve security by allowing for the establishment of legitimate accounts through email verification, and password resets, and also notifications can be sent to students about upcoming due dates.

Cloud integration, moving library data from a local database to the cloud may be necessary due to the growth in students, books, and other workload complexity. By making the appropriate adjustments, this software application can be moved to a cloud database. With the use of cloud computing, data backup will be easy, remote update and synchronization will be possible, and much more. 

Data addition, There are many potential additions to the data, including PDFs of textbooks and previous year's examinations, and recorded lectures of classes will be beneficial to any academic institution. 

Feedback mechanism, To quickly identify users having any problems using this application, a feedback and complaint mechanism can also be added.
